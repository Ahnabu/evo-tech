# Order Management Updates - Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Order Status & Payment Status Filters** 
**Problem**: Filters weren't working because API route was sending snake_case field names to backend that expects camelCase.

**Solution**: Updated `/api/admin/orders/route.ts` to convert query params:
- `order_status` → `orderStatus` (backend param)
- `payment_status` → `paymentStatus` (backend param)

### 2. **Order Details Page**
**Problem**: Order details page existed but wasn't properly configured.

**Solution**: 
- Created complete API routes in `/api/admin/orders/[orderId]/route.ts` with GET, PUT, DELETE methods
- Updated order details page to fetch data via Next.js API route
- Combined order and items data into unified `OrderWithItemsType` object

### 3. **Order Update Functionality**
**Problem**: No clear way to update order status from details page.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `OrderUpdateForm` component with:
  - Router refresh after successful update
  - Better error handling with console logging
  - Success toast notifications
- Form allows updating:
  - Order Status (pending → confirmed → processing → shipped → delivered)
  - Payment Status (pending → paid → failed → refunded)
  - Tracking Code

### 4. **Order Status Display**
**Problem**: Order status wasn't visible in the details page.

**Solution**:
- Added `getOrderStatusBadge()` function with color-coded badges:
  - **Pending** - Default gray
  - **Confirmed** - In progress blue
  - **Processing** - In progress blue
  - **Shipped** - Warning yellow
  - **Delivered** - Success green
  - **Cancelled** - Failed red
- Added order status display in Order Information card
